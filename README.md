These are the source code of my old static website (it should be a "blog" but I just got lazy lol). I built it with the static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed on Netlify. If you want to focus on the writing itself, I also recommand [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).  
You can take a look at my [new website](https://yifeili.me) if you want! :D
