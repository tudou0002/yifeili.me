### About
Hello :wave:, I'm Yifei Li. I graduated from McGill University with a degree in Computer Science, where I had the privilege of working with Prof. [Reihaneh Rabbany](http://www.reirab.com/) on a project aimed at combating human trafficking in Canada. I'm now an incoming Master's student at University of British Columbia, supervised by Prof. [Laks V.S. Lakshmanan](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~laks/). My research interests are in natural language processing and data mining. Previously, I worked at Morgan Stanley as a Site Reliability Engineer.
